ClickBlitz is a small, accurate & portable auto-clicker written in C++. This auto-clicker's goal is to reach highly accurate click speeds, while also being easy to use.

It can easily reach the speeds specified by the user, unlike many other autoclickers. It does this by not using any system sleep() function. Instead, it uses busy-waiting (empty while loop with a clock). This enables for acurate speeds.

Software requirements:
- Windows XP *and above*
- A CPU 🐟
